Form is where brand comes into play. It's how colour, type, and other visual styling choices are applied to the components in Function. It's about brand expression, polish, identity, uniqueness, emotion, and beauty. Form is the part of design people tend to think of when you say "design," and it only really comes into play once the Foundation and Function are solid. It's the skin that makes the apple look delicious, to mix a metaphor.

Form is where brand expression and beauty comes into play: essentially theming, it's how visual styling is applied to the Functional components making use of the core rules and variables provided by the Foundation.

Foundation → Form
`$pink-500: #D1478E;` → `$color-accent: $pink-500;`

Form is about brand tokens. It also allows for per-brand overrides, because sometimes you just need to be a special snowflake.
