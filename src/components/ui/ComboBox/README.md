A ComboBox is a selection control that allows a user to choose from a list of options. Depending on the parameters passed...


```jsx

<ComboBox label="Choose your favourite fruit" placeholder="Search or browse" />

```

basically an HTML `select` on steroids. 

A combo box combines a text field with a pull-down button in a single control. The user can enter a custom value into the field or click the button to choose from a list of predefined values. When the user enters a custom value, itâ€™s not added to the list of choices.

<ComboBox label="Select a thing" placeholder="Search or browse">
    <ComboBoxHeading>Automattic</ComboBoxHeading>
    <ComboBoxOption>om.co</ComboBoxOption>
</ComboBox>
