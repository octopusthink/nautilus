A `<SkipLink>` provides a way to quickly navigate to the main "content" of your page with the keyboard. It is mainly used as an accessibility feature for keyboard/screenreader users to navigate to your content without needing to tab through many navigation items/UI elements.

```jsx
<SkipLink />
```
