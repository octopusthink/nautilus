`Nautilus` is the base component (eg. the _higher-order component_ or _HOC_) used to inject the Nautilus Design System into your app. It provides a `theme` prop used to customise your Nautilus components, as well as injecting some sane default styles into your app. Your "root" components should be wrapped in the `<Nautilus>` component; any of your components that use a Nautilus component will need to be wrapped in a `<Nautilus>` component.
