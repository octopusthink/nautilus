## Getting Started

```

### Installing

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/octopusthink/nautilus.git`

Navigate to the directory:

`cd nautilus`

Use `npm` to compile files and watch for changes:

`npm start`

This will start a server for the styleguide at http://localhost:6060/ and watch for any changes.
You'll need to restart `npm` if you make changes to `styleguide.config.js`, but otherwise you should be good to go!
