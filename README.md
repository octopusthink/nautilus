# Nautilus

An open-source design system optimised for accessibility, quality, and flexibility. Built for the web.

https://nautilus.octopusthink.com/

## Usage ‚å®Ô∏è

Want to use Nautilus in your next web app? Well: tough! It's much too early and it's nowhere near ready for production usage. Check back later. üòÖ

You can _technically_ install it from NPM, but you can't say we didn't warn you!

```bash
npm install @octopusthink/nautilus
```

## Development üõ†

Want to contribute to Nautilus, or test it locally? Here's how!

### Prerequisites

- `node` (LTS)
- `npm`

### Installing

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/octopusthink/nautilus.git
```

Navigate into the directory:

```
cd nautilus
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

And use `npm` to compile files, watch for changes, and build the styleguide:

`npm start`

This will start a server for the styleguide at http://localhost:6060/ and watch for any changes.
You'll need to restart `npm` if you make changes to `styleguide.config.js`, but otherwise you should be good to go!

## Running the tests

We use `jest` to run our unit tests. If you've made changes, `jest` will only run tests on files related to your changes:

```
npm test
```

### Linting

We lint our code using `eslint` and `prettier`. You can check your changes for linting violations with:

```
npm run lint
```

## Built With

* [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org) - Running the styleguide.
