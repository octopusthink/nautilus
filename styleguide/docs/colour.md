## Principles

### 1. Colour is accessible.

When choosing colours, take into account users with various forms of colour blindness or low vision. Colour should never be the sole indicator of meaning. Include icons, shapes, or text to supplement anything communicated via colour. Text contrast must pass AA across the board. Test designs in grayscale.

### 2. Colour expresses meaning.

Don't throw colour at an element at random. Colour can be decorative in both editorial and product contexts, but clear communication is more important than pretty colours.

Colour can be used to reinforce meaning (error and success messages), to group related items that aren't in physical proximity, to reinforce similar interaction patterns, to denote the most important element on a page, or to guide users more efficiently through an interface. Colour choices should be intentional and rational.

### 3. Colour focuses attention.

The use of color should help bring attention to the most important element of a page. Color should support the hierarchy of the page. Use restraint with colour elsewhere in order to focus users attention on the task at hand or the most important element on a screen.

### 4. Colour considers its context.

Colour, when used to express meaning, is highly dependent on cultural norms. White may mean purity to a Western audience, but it can mean death to an Eastern one. To skillfully make use of colour's emotional resonance, it's important to have an understanding of your audience and the cultural context in which your design will live.

In many countries, colour is also tightly coupled to political parties, which may have consequences you don't initially anticipate when choosing your colours.

This palette has been designed to be flexible enough to build a wide variety of different distinct colour palettes for a range of brand expression, whilst retaining a sense of consistency and balance across different product lines.

## Colour tokens

When applying colours to elements, rather than applying the colour directly, it's best to use Nautilus' Colour Tokens. Colour Tokens are variables for the semantic use of colour in the interface, set by the theme. Using these Colour Tokens rather than applying colour values directly mean that it's easier to make cross-site changes to colour in a rational way.

## Choosing colours

**Themes** can select primary, secondary, and accent colours for a brand and the colours will be automatically applied to elements in a consistent way. For themes that require more granular control of colour choices, semantic and component colours can also be set by themes directly.

Whilst we recommend choosing colours from Nautilus' palette for increased harmony and usability, you can use any colour values in your theme.

### Accessible colour

The steps in Nautilus' palette are designed to help make it simpler to make accessible colour choices. Any colour value of 500 or above will have sufficient contrast against white for AAA contrast, and any colour value of 400 or below will have sufficient contrast against black for AAA contrast.
