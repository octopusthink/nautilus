Inline text components are Nautilus-implementations of components like `<strong>` or `<em>` that appear inside other text components (like `<Paragraph>` or `<List>`). We offer our own components to scope styles only to our components, but also to allow for extra props over the standard HTML elements.

In the future, these components will also work inside React-Native components.
