Nautilus is a design system, built for flexibility, efficiency, and beauty.

Nautilus is a perpetual work-in-progress that is currently very much in-progress. If you'd like to use it for something: feel free! If you'd like to fork it and make something new, you can do that too. Nautilus is open-source, open-design, and open to contributions. Feel free to file an issue or open a PR [on GitHub](https://github.com/octopusthink/nautilus) if you notice anything amiss, or if you'd just like to say hi! ðŸ‘‹

Nautilus is structured into three sections:

## Foundation

Principles, guidelines, core design tokens.

_Example: colour palettes_

Start here if you're just getting started.

## Function

Components, patterns, and layouts. Everything that's a React component. Function provides a series of components and patterns with a defined behaviour.

_Example: a button or a card_

Start here if you're looking to build something right away.

## Form

Form is brand expression, polish, identity, uniqueness, emotion, beauty. Form is where brand expression and beauty comes into play: essentially themeing, it's how visual styling is applied to the Functional components making use of the core rules and variables provided by the Foundation.

_Example: primary colour, border-radius_

Start here if you're looking to take your app/site and make it your own.

## So how does it all fit together

So the colour ramps would belong in Foundation, whereas accent colours belong to Form. In css structure, this becomes the overriddable stuff, which theoretically makes for a more robustly flexible system.

So, for instance, Foundation provides a core set of colour palettes with a wide range.

This will make a whole lot more sense once the system is  a bit more fleshed out, but for now, just trust me that it'll all make  sense in time, and once there's a diagram.
