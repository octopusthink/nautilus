Function is a collection of functional patterns, defined as much as possible by their function.

We reference these in three layers:
- components (buttons, headings) make up the smallest unit
- patterns (cards, navigation) are comprised of components pieced together
- layouts (search results, article page) are full-page layouts comprising of patterns and components

Function provides a series of components and patterns with a defined behaviour. Basically, if something is a React component, it's going to be in here. And basically everything is a React component, so if you're looking to build something, start here.
