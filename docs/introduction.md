### Hello 

Nautilus is a design system, built for flexibility, efficiency, and beauty. 

Nautilus is based in part on [Ether](https://ether.thescenery.co), with heavy contributions from an array of other design systems. It's a perpetual work in progress that is currently very much in progress. If you'd like to use it  for something, feel free! If you'd like to fork it and make something new, you can do that too. Nautilus is open-source, open-design, and open to contributions. Feel free to file an issue or open a PR [on Github](https://github.com/octopusthink/nautilus) if you notice anything amiss, or if you'd just like to say hi! ðŸ‘‹
